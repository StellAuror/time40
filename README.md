The repository contains the source code for a Shiny application. This application aims to streamline the process of selecting teas and coffees based on information about price ranges, ratings, and properties of infusions or coffee beans.
## Scrapping
The application retrieves data from the [Five O'Clock](https://fiveoclock.eu) website. The algorithm is designed to avoid overloading their servers (sequential scraping).

## Data presentation
The application consists of four visualizations. After exploring these visualizations, users should have all the necessary information to evaluate the storeâ€™s assortment, specific infusions, or coffee beans.

### Analysis
Choosing tea or coffee types occurs in a pop-up.

Once the selection is accepted, take some time to brew your own cup of tea to avoid evaluating it purely in theory! :)

Teas are available in various variants. The first visualization displays price ranges in which each tea type falls. After identifying an interesting price range, users can filter the results accordingly. Next, user ratings for teas are analyzed, with this information available for each tea category. Additionally, a word cloud provides insights into the most important properties of teas using text mining methods.

Finally, users can review detailed information about teas in tabular form, including input data.
